    // ── R1 witnesses: denial wins over concurrent restart. ───────────────────

    // Two complementary schedules that together prove the R1 fix:
    //
    // 1. b3_denial_precedes_restart_when_denial_already_won (below):
    //    Frame already on terminal_ctrl_rx when restart arm fires.  Reason is
    //    set; recv() returns immediately with the existing frame.
    //
    // 2. r1_denial_precedes_restart_reason_won_frame_arrives_during_recv (below):
    //    Reason set (AuthorizationDenied) but terminal_ctrl_rx is EMPTY when the
    //    restart arm checks.  The arm calls bounded recv(); a concurrent task
    //    enqueues the frame while recv() is waiting.  This covers the race window
    //    documented at state.rs:295-310 where reason is published under the
    //    transition lock before try_send.
    //
    // Mutation evidence (applies to both):
    //   A) Remove the `disconnect_reason` watch check + recv() from the restart
    //      arm → restarts always send 1012 even when denial won → first assertion
    //      panics (denial frame missing or flushed=true).
    //   B) Keep reason check but use try_recv() only (no bounded recv()) → race
    //      schedule 2 returns Err(Empty) → 1012 sent instead of denial → panics.

    //   5. Call `state.conn_manager.disconnect_nip_fi(pubkey)` from the test.
    //      This: wins reason → enqueues denial frame → fires cancel.
    //      The expiry task is now in quiescence (write lock blocked by permit).
    //   6. Release hook → handler proceeds: registers subscription in sub_registry,
    //      retains Global topic in pubsub, finishes REQ, drops permit.
    //   7. Quiescence unblocks → expiry task completes.
    //   8. recv_loop detects cancel → sends denial frame + POLICY close →
    //      connection epilogue:
    //        nip_fi_expiry_task.await (already done)
    //        sub_registry.remove_connection → 0 subscriptions
    //        pubsub.release_topic(Global) → 0 topic refcounts
    //   9. Observe exactly one canonical denial frame then the POLICY close on the WS.

    //  11. Assert: total_subscriptions() == 0 and topic_refcount(Global) == 0
    //      and topic_refcount(Channel) == 0.
    //
    // Mutation evidence:
    //   A) Remove `gate.quiesce().await` from expiry task cancel arm →
    //      task exits before REQ registers → remove_connection finds nothing →
    //      sub orphans after hook release → total_subscriptions() stays 1 at step 11
